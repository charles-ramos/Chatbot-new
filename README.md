# Samaritan, Food Chatbot

## About this Project
"Samaritan" is a proprietary NLP-based Chatbot assistant (like Chatgpt but for food) built using Python3 that will fetch (through prompt) our real-time, collected and researched pricing data (in all major currencies) of Africa's informal food markets and present them to users in a simplified way via question and answer format (prompts) on a web dashboard. It uses NLP and Deep-Learning to analyse the user's message, classify it into the a broader category and then reply with a suitable message or the required information. It is hosted using flask.
