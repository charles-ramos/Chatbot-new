Blend till smooth, about a minute or two. You should have roughly 6 cups of blended mixture. \n Pour the mixture into a large pan and bring it to the boil. Then turn down the heat, cover, and leave to simmer for 10-12 minutes. \n In a large pan, heat the oil and add the sliced onions. Season with a pinch of salt and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes. \n Add the bay leaves, curry powder, dried thyme, and a pinch of black pepper and continue to simmer for 3-4 minutes on medium heat. \n Then add the tomato paste and stir for another 2 minutes. \n Add the reduced tomato-pepper-Scotch bonnet mixture, stir, and leave on medium heat for 10-12 minutes with the lid on till reduced by half. This is the mixture that will define the pot. \n Add 4 cups of the stock to the cooked tomato sauce and bring it to a boil for 1-2 minutes. NB: The water added after the ground tomato puree must be the same level as the rice. This prevents the rice from becoming soggy. \n Add the rinsed rice and butter, stir, cover with a double piece of foil/baking or parchment paper, and put on the lid. This will seal in the steam and lock in the flavor. Turn down the heat and cook on low for 30 minutes. Place a focus on low to medium heat so that the rice may cook on its own and the water can evaporate without burning the food. \n Stir the rice, taste and adjust the seasoning as required. If you like, add sliced onions, fresh tomatoes, and the 2nd teaspoon of butter and stir through. \n To make Party Rice, there is one more step. Now Party Rice is essentially Smoky Jollof Rice, traditionally cooked over an open fire. However, you can achieve the same results on the stove top. Here is how.. \n Once the rice is cooked, turn up the heat with the lid on and leave to burn just a little bit for 3 to 5 minutes. You will hear the rice crackle and snap, and it will smell toasted. Turn off the heat and leave with the lid on to cool till ready to serve. The longer the lid stays on, the smokier the rice will be. \n Keep in mind that while using parboiled rice, once the water evaporates completely, the rice is ready. There is no need to add water as this can also make it clump together. \n Enjoy the meal!"],

Overcrowding the oil lowers the oil temperature and we are back to the first point above. \n How to prevent chinchin from soaking up a lot of oil when frying. \n 1. The oil wasn't hot enough: Before you frying the chin chin. Always test the heated oil by putting a piece of chin chin in the oil . If oil bubbles and the piece of chin chin comes up immediately then the oil is ready for frying. \n 2. The Oil wasn't enough for the amount of chin chin dough being fried: Always fry your chin chin with enough oil. Frying chin chin requires deep frying which requires enough oil. \n 3. Overcrowding the oil with dough: Make sure you have enough oil to fry your dough.

Otherwise, it is paired with either pap or custard and served as breakfast or dinner. \n Tip and Tricks for making the perfect Crunchy Akara: \n There are 4 species of black-eyed peas in Nigeria and you'll need the smallest one for this recipe. While buying the beans, ask for akara beans (beans used for making akara or moi moi). If you can't find it, you can use any beans you find because they are almost the same. Although store-bought peeled black eyed peas work for this recipe, I recommend you to use shelled (black-eyed peas with the skin on). They deliver that perfect crunchy bite. One key essential step is whipping the batter just like you would a cake, in fast circles to get as much air into the mixture as possible, making it light and airy. This usually takes about 4-5 minutes. You can't miss out this step. And while you fry one batch, you have to continue beating the batter before frying the next. Let it cook an extra 1-2 minutes for a more golden brown exterior and an even better crunch. Akara (bean cake) requires just 3 main ingredients. \n Serving: 4 Persons, Preparation time: 60 minutes, Waiting time: 120 minutes \n Ingredients: 1.5 cups beans, 5 scotch bonnet peppers, Half cup sliced onions, Salt, 3 litres Vegetable Oil, 1 shombo pepper. \n How to Prepare Akara (Bean Cake): \n Put the beans in a clean bowl, sprinkle just very little water (half cup), and start squeezing hard against your palm. As you do this repeatedly, the outer coat will start peeling off. Sprinkle more water on but never allow them to soak; just keep squeezing and rubbing against your palm for 2 minutes. \n Add water and let the outer layer fall off freely. Keep rubbing against your palm, add more water and peel off. It takes about 10 minutes to de-coat beans. \n Soak the beans in water for 45 minutes. Blend the peeled beans using a smart blender or commercial grinding mill. Add the shombo or tatashe and blend. You don't want to add too much water otherwise your akara will pour right into the oil and settle at the bottom of the pot. \n After grinding the beans for akara (bean cake), leave them to rest in a bowl for 1 hour. This makes the beans swell a little and ensure a better bonding between the molecules. Transfer to a mortar and further smoothen with a pestle for 15 minutes. If you don't have mortar and pestle, use a blender and pulse them a couple of times. \n How to Fry Akara (Bean Cake): \n Heat 3 liters of oil in a cooking pot. Let it heat up for 3-5 minutes before you scoop in some of the bartar to see if it floats. Scoop in more. Drop the sliced peppers and onions on top. \n Fry until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes turning once. Fry in batches and do not over crowd pan as this could lead to soggy akara. Remove from the hot oil with a slotted spoon, drain well, and serve."],

This should top the chart of ultimate street foods from the north of Nigeria. Dambu Nama is a delicacy from the north of Nigeria, that can best be described as spicy fried meat floss. Floss because the meat is shredded so thin it feels like cotton candy floss in your mouth. It is flavourful and moreish, you wouldn't even realise you have gone through an entire batch in a few minutes. Yaji aka Suya Spice is what gives this its unique flavour and aroma, so ensure you get good yaji spice. Dambu Nama is typically made with Ram Meat (best option though) or Beef, but it is quite common to find Dambu now made with Chicken. Chicken Dambu is usually softer and easier to floss. Dambu Nama can be eaten as a snack or incorporated into other meals in many ways. \n Recipe \n Ingredients (measurements for the recipe are mostly eyeballed, so please cook with your heart and taste buds): Raw Meat, Onions (chopped), Garlic (chopped), Ginger (chopped), Cayenne Pepper (aka ground chilli pepper), Yaji Spice (Suya Spice), *Ginger powder (optional), Bay Leaf, Salt, *Seasoning cubes (optional), Water and Vegetable oil (for frying) \n Procedure \n Rinse your meat, add your chopped, onions, garlic, ginger, cayenne pepper, yaji spice, salt, seasoning cubes and some water. \n Cook till the meat is cooked soft enough that it can easily fall apart. You can cook in a pressure pot to speed the process up. \n Take the meats out from the broth. Traditionally you need a mortar and pestle to pound the meats to separate the fibres. In the absence of a mortar and pestle, use a fork to pull the meats apart to flossy strings. You can smash on a chopping board or clean flat surface using a rolling pin, or mallet. \n Season with *ginger powder*, yaji spice, chilli pepper as you pound, if necessary some more salt. \n Heat up some oil till hot, now you want the oil hot enough so the meats don't sit too long and soak up oil, you also don't want the oil too hot so as not to fry too fast and burn the meats. \n Fry the meat to a light golden-brown \n Collect it in a wire mesh sieve so all the oil strains out. I laid an oil absorbent paper towel at the base of my sieve to draw out the oil. \n Spread the fried floss on a tray to air dry and sprinkle a generous amount of Yaji Spice. Resist the urge to dry the ready dambu nama in the oven, it can become too dehydrated and start to flake and crumble. \n To store, pack into an airtight container. You can refrigerate it for a longer shelf life and of course enjoy with love!!"],

For our readers in the diaspora who sometimes wonder how to  cheat with some of the Nigerian recipes, this is for you. Traditionally groundnut soup is made with raw groundnut, ground to a fine powder. Anyway I found myself with a very dear friend who's blender didn't have a dry mill and she didn't have a coffee blender either, and I had promised to make her groundnut soup. So we decided to experiment with peanut butter. We reached for a jar of Skippy Peanut butter from her panty and went to work hoping it would come out great. I can tell you it did. \n Recipe \n Ingredients - 1 1/2 cups Peanut butter, 3 dried Cameroon pepper, 2 tbsp Ground pepper (Ata rodo /Scotch Bonnet /Habenero), 1 Tsp Uziza seeds, 1/4 cup Palm oil, Cooked Assorted Meats and Fish, 3 cups beef Stock, 1/8 cup crushed dried Efirin leaves, Salt and Seasoning cubes  (Maggi or knorr … etc ) to taste.\n NB: If you are vegan, skip the meats, fish and crayfish, replace with dried mushrooms, tofu or any other vegan meat replacement. \n Procedure \n Blend the Cameroon pepper and uziza seeds together to powder, if you have a dry mill blender. If you have a regular blender, blend the uziza and Cameroon pepper with the other pepper and some water. \n In a pot, add the meat stock and the peanut butter, stir the peanut butter in the meat stock till it dissolves completely. Put your cooker on medium heat. \n Add, palm oil, Uziza, and ground peppers now. Allow to cook for about 3 mins the add the meats and fish. Taste for seasoning and add additional seasoning if necessary. Leave the pot covered and cook for about 10mins, add about 2 cups water if the consistency is too thick. Cook on medium heat. \n Because peanut butter is very oily you'd notice the oil start to float at the top, that is why you need very minimal palm oil. Add the efirin leaves and stir it in, turn the heat down to low and turn it off about 3 minutes after. \n Enjoy your peanut butter soup with any starchy accompaniment as you would your native soup..."],

Oha (also spelt and pronounced as Ora) is a delicate vegetable and has a very unique flavour. \n Recipe \n Ingredients : Oha leaves (a handful), Cocoyam (8 small corms or Alternatively 1 1/2 tablespoon of ground Achi, Red Palm Oil (2 cooking spoons), Assorted Beef meats, Assorted dry Fish, Fresh peppers (scotch bonnet / habenero /ata rodo), fresh Cameroon\nsukka pepper, Salt to taste, Crayfish (powdered), Seasoning Cubes and 1 teaspoon Ogiri Igbo (for the traditional taste but optional).\n NB: If you are vegan, skip the meats, fish and crayfish, replace with dried mushrooms, tofu or any other vegan meat replacement. \n Procedure \n • Grind pepper and set aside. \n • Wash and boil the cocoyam till soft. \n • Remove the peels and in a blender, blend to a smooth paste you can also use a mortar and pestle, that is the more traditional approach. \n • Wash oha leaves. Using your fingers, cut the Ora (Oha) leaves into tiny pieces. It is said that this technique is to prevent the vegetable from becoming darker in colour which happens when you cut the ora leaves with a knife. We've tried cutting oha with a knife and it didn't turn dark, but then we cut and used immediately. I'd say whatever rocks your boat. Set it aside. \n • Season and boil the meats, when they are tender add stock fish and dry fish. \n • Add the pepper, ogiri Igbo and ground crayfish and cook for 10 minutes. Add the cocoyam paste in small lumps and then the palm oil. If using achi, just stir it in, starting with 1 tbsp first. Achi is a thicken and it sometimes has a slightly slippery consistency. \n • Cover the pot and leave to cook on high heat till all the cocoyam lumps have dissolved. You can add more water if you feel that the soup is too thick. * Remove smoked catfish If you are using any at this point to prevent disintegration. \n • Add the oha (ora) leaves and leave to cook for about 3 - 5 minutes with the lid off. \n • Serve with your favourite starchy side dish."],

Though the seeds of the Bush Mango (common names wild mango, African mango, bush mango, dika, odika, modika, Òro, andok or ogbono) are more popularly called Ogbono, the yorubas call it Apon. I've always described Ogbono soup as draw soup which is the local lingo for soups with this kind of viscosity, like Okra soup. I just learnt the more apt word is mucilaginous. A mouthful right, but less offensive than slimy. Ogbono is one of those soups that the flavour greatly improves when it has been left untouched overnight. \n Recipe \n INGREDIENTS: Ogbono Seeds (a 170g milk tin size), Assorted Meats (tripe/ponmo/meat), Assorted Fish (smoked catfish / stockfish), ⅛ cup crayfish, ½ tsp Uziza seeds, 2 unshelled Ehuru seeds (African calabash nutmeg) optional but recommended, ½ tbsp Cameron Pepper, Cayenne pepper (ground dried  chilli pepper), 1 tbsp palm oil, 1 tsp ogiri (optional) and Salt. \n NB: If you are vegan, skip the meats, fish and crayfish, replace with dried mushrooms, tofu or any other vegan meat replacement.\n Procedure \n • Season and cook your meats with the head of the smoked catfish, and some stockfish. This gives you a very rich stock. Cook meats till tender and reserve the stock.\n • Rinse stock fish with hot water, if a little tough soak in salted warm water. Shred catfish is you desire. Don't discard the extra heads, save it for you cooking meats for added flavour.\n • Toast uziza and ehuru seeds slightly in pan with the Ogbono seeds, till they pop slightly.\n • Grind Ogbono and uziza, ehuru seeds with crayfish in a dry mill blender.\n • Put a clean dry pot on medium heat and add palm  oil, next add the ground Ogbono and stir till all lumps are dissolved now add your meat stock, if you don't have meat stock add water. The soup starts to thicken and get viscous.\n • Now add ground cayenne and cameroon pepper. These peppers pack heat so use only as much as you can handle.\n • Taste the soup, if you used stock you may not need to add any more seasoning if not add some.\n • Dissolve ogiri with water and add to cooking soup.\n • Add meats and fish and allow to cook for about 15 minutes with lid off.\n • If the soup is too viscous, add some water to thin it out.\n • Let it simmer for 3 minutes then turn the heat off.\n • Ogbono soup is typically served with Swallows like Amala, Eba (Garri), Pounded yam, Semo but I find it very delicious with rice.

 "responses": ["Afia Efere - Efik White Soup: This is an oil-less soup native to the Efik people of Nigeria. It is similar to Ofe Nsala which is native to the Igbo people. The difference in spices used in cooking sets it apart from Nsala. While it's not white in the true sense of the word, the name alludes to the fact that it isn't cooked with palm oil, and yam is used as the thickener. Uyayak (Aidan Fruit pod, tetrapleura tetraptera) is integral to the cooking and for the flavor of Afia Efere. That's a key ingredient that differentiates it from Nsala. Uyayak (Aridan, Oshosho, Osakirisa, Ubukirihu) has a beautiful flavor and aroma, slightly sweet and fragrant. Afia Efere, can be made with any meats or fish, but we find goat meat to be the more robust in flavor. Unlike Nsala whose thickeners can either be yam, cocoyam, achi, ofor, etc… yam is almost strictly the only thickener used for Afia Efere. Efik food purists find it sacrilegious to use onions in cooking Efik soups and Afia Efere isn't exempt. So keep the onions away if you don't want them to invoke the wrath of their ancestors. Now let's cook some Afia Efere. \n Recipe \nIngredients: Meats of choice (either goat meat, beef or chicken), Smoked Catfish, Uyayak, Yam, Crayfish powder, Yellow Cameroon pepper (fresh or powdered), Water, Salt, *Seasoning cubes, *Deshelled Ehuru (calabash nutmeg), *Uda (grains of Selim, negro pepper), *Asterisked items are optional, Uyayak (Aidan Fruit Pod, Tetrapleura Tetraptera), Uda (Negro Pepper, Grains of Selim) and Ehuru (Calabash Nutmeg) \n Procedure \n • Toast the Uyayak lightly in pan activate the oils and flavors. If using Ehuru and Uda toast them too. Don't use a lot of Uda too much can make your soup bitter. I won't recommend more than two.\n • Put your meat in a pot, with Uyayak, smoked fish, salt, seasoning cubes, Cameroon pepper, *uda and Ehuru, water. Cook till meats are well cooked.\n • While the meats are cooking boil one or two slices of yam in water without salt. Once cooked pound till smooth or use a food processor to get it to pounded yam consistency. Set it aside.\n • Once the meats are cooked, add more water, scoop small lumps of the pounded yam into the meat and broth, adjust the seasonings accordingly, add crayfish powder and allow to cook with lid on till the yam paste dissolves. If the consistency is too thick loosen it up with water, if it is too loose, add some more paste and cook with lid off to allow water to evaporate.\n • Once cooked turn heat off and serve with your favorite accompaniment.

 "responses": ["Ofe Nsala (White Soup). I've had this recipe sitting in my draft for a while now. Asides being plagued with a bad phone, I have been very preoccupied. I'm not from the south eastern part of Nigeria but more often that not, people ask me if I'm igbo, probably due to my fair skin. I love soups from the south east of Nigeria, that doesn't mean I'd give up my love for Ewedu and Gbegiri any time soon. Nsala soup asides being great with starchy accompaniments, it is spicy and perfect for a cold rainy day or as a remedy for a flu. \nRecipe \n INGREDIENTS: Cat Fish: 4 one-inch thick pieces, Fresh or dry Utazi Leaves, Thickener: White Cocoyam/ White Yam / Yam Powder / Potato Puree or Achi, Scotch Bonnet (Ata Rodo/ Habanero peppers). I like to use Yellow and Red using more of Yellow, Salt (to taste), Crayfish (a handful for 4 cuts of fish), 1 Seasoning cube and Ogiri Okpei. \n Procedure \n- Wash properly and cut the catfish into 1 inch thick cylindrical discs and remove the intestines.\n - Place in bowl and pour very hot water on the fish. This process of pouring hot water on the fish toughens the skin of the fish so that the pieces do not disintegrate while cooking the soup. Leave for about 2 minutes and wash the fish with cold water. \n You should also wash off any slimy substance on the outer skin of the fish at this time. (See Tips for cooking catfish). \n- Boil a few cubes of cocoyam. When soft, pound with a mortar and pestle till a smooth paste is formed, then set aside. I use a blender because it is faster and I get a smooth puree. You can substitute white yam with yam powder , cocoyam powder or potato puree for the thickening.\n- Wash and pound/blend the utazi leaves, the chilli pepper and the crayfish and set aside. Utazi is bitter in taste and only used for flavouring so one or two leaves should be enough especially when using the fresh leaves.\n- Place the catfish in a pot and pour enough water to cover the fish. Add the seasoning and cook till done. Feel free to add dry fish to this soup recipe.\n- When the catfish is almost done, add the crayfish, pepper and utazi leaves blend. Also add the yam paste in small lumps and salt to taste.\n- Cover the pot and allow the contents to cook at high heat till all the yam paste have dissolved. While cooking, if you think that the yam paste will make the soup too thick, you can remove some that are yet to dissolve. \n Your Ofe Nsala is ready to eat alone or with a starchy accompaniment e.g Eba, Semo, Pounded yam e.t.c"],

It's good to start with enough water to cook the entire soup, or you can be adding more as you progress. \n • Once the meat is cooked, taste to check the seasoning, if need be, adjust the seasoning.\n • Add palm oil and then let it cook for about five to seven minutes.\n • Dissolve the kaun in a little water and add to the pot, you may want to lower the heat at the point because there is a chance the soup will froth over into the fire. You will observe that the palm oil will take on an orange hue. Let is cook for about 2 minutes or a little more.\n • Then add the dissolved starch (or garri if you are using garri), stirring continuously as you add into the pot until the soup is thick. (It should have the consistency of runny cooked custard or pap, enough to coat the back of a metal spoon and still drip).\n • Turn the heat down and let it simmer for roughly 10minutes before turning off the heat. \n • Serve with Eba, Starch or your favourite swallow..."],

 "responses": ["Obe Ewedu (Ewedu Soup). Ewedu Soup is popularly eaten by the Yoruba people of the South Western Part of Nigeria. Slimy is not a nice word to use to describe Ewedu Soup so we call it draw soup because of the way it stretches. The more apt word will be mucilaginous. A delicious tasting soup that pairs well with tomato/pepper stew and and Gbegiri. Any Buka(eatery) worth its salt in Ibadan, Oyo State, would make the biggest portion of its sales from Amala and Ewedu also Abula (Amala/Gbegiri/Ewedu/Stew/Goat meat). Amongst Yoruba people, one of the first solids a baby is introduced to is Amala and Ewedu. Ewedu helps the starchy solid slide easily down the baby's throat. It is also a great way to add other nourishing goodness in the meal for the baby to eat e.g Mashed Mackerel, Crayfish, liver, locust beans… etc.\n** For those who live outside Nigeria, these are other names for Ewedu and you might find them in the frozen goods section in your African or Asian store. Jute Leaves, West Africa Sorrel, Jam leaf, Krin-Krin, Saluyot, Rau day, Jew Mallow, Melokhia, Meloukhia, Mulukhiyah, Mulukhiyya, Malukhiyah. \nRecipe INGREDIENTS (Serves 8 - 10): 200g Ewedu Leaves, 1 (4 cups)litre water, ½ tsp Kaun -edible potash- (optional), 2 tbsp Iru (locust beans), *1 seasoning cube, Salt to taste and *optional Crayfish, flaked mackerel, egusi powder.\n Procedure \n- Pick the leaves off the stem of the Ewedu and rinse thoroughly to get rid of sand. \n- Place a pot on heat, add water and the Kaun.\n- As the water starts the heat, the Kaun dissolves and froths like this. Add the Ewedu and cook till tender. Ewedu can be cooked without kaun. There are questions as to how healthy it is to consume kaun these days. Ewedu will soften and will draw without kaun so you can skip it.\n- To check for the tenderness of the Ewedu, use a spoon to scoop a leaf and use your thumb to press it. It should break apart with little pressure applied. Now add your Iru, cook for about a minute longer, turn off the heat and pulverize your Ewedu. Now, there are two popular variants of iru sold in the market (Nigerian), Woro and Pete. Woro is whole fermented locust beans while Pete is the Mashed fermented Locust beans. Pete is typically used for Ewedu however, use whichever one you prefer though. \n- Traditionally a short broom called Ijabe is use to beat the Ewedu to tiny bits to complete the cooking. Ijabe is not any broom used in the house converted to use for cooking. It is made for the purpose of cooking. Alternatively, use a blender. \nIjabe - This is how an Ijabe is used. The Broom is moved up and down in continuous swifts motion this all the leaves are completely broken up. * If like me you are not crazy about ijabe please use your blender but not without allowing the Ewedu to cool down first.\n- Once done, return to low heat, add salt and Seasoning cubes. Simmer on low heat for about 3 minutes and turn off the heat. Then enjoy!"],

Cook till tender. When the beans is tender you can either use the tradition broom whisk -ijabe- to whisk the beans to a purée or pass through a fine sieve collecting the smooth pulp into a pot or use a blender to blend it to a smooth paste. If you use the broom or the blender you still have to pass through a fine sieve to remove any chaff or residue. \n • Return the Pulp to the heat and and add your palm oil, pepper, locust beans, powdered crayfish, seasoning cubes and salt to taste add a little more water if necessary to let the soup be slightly runny.\n • Cook on medium heat and watch the soup as it has a tendency to boil over. \n • Cook till the soup starts to thicken slightly and turn off the heat - this is because gbegiri has the tendency to quickly turn to a thick sludge when it cools. The consistency you are looking for is that it can slightly coat the back of a spoon. \n • Serve with Ewedu or alone like I have it here and enjoy with Amala or Amala Lafun (white /cassava Amala ) or any of your favourite swallow..."],

Palm Oil: It is palm oil that gives Okpa the orangey-yellow color it is known for and that makes it so appetizing just by looking at it. \n3. Okpa Wrap Materials: Banana or Uma leaves, aluminum cups, or heatproof nylons are required to hold the batter tight while cooking into a delicious Okpa cake. If using dry banana leaves or plantain leaves, use twine or string to tie the wraps. Normally, the string found in the home is from a rice bag garri sack white bag. Just cut them into sizable lengths, wash them, and pull out to detach the string needed. \n4. Grounded or Fresh Pepper: Of course, this is to add a sharp taste, scent, and flavor to the mix. \n5. Onions: Best if diced, for those that love onions but they are not mandatory. \n6. Seasoning Stock Cubes: Helps to enhance taste. \n7. Salt: The salt is for taste and makes all the ingredients blend together. \n8. Lukewarm Water: Lukewarm water aids the Okpa flour to bond with the palm oil mixture, and makes the batter fluffy. \nHow to Make Okpa: \n • Measure the Okpa flour into a clean mixing bowl and pour in some palm oil. \n • Gently knead the dough until it gets an orangey-yellow color. Add the ground crayfish, pepper, stock, diced onion, and salt. \n • Pour in some lukewarm water until you get your preferred consistency. For a softer texture, add more water to the mixture, but do not flood it with water. Mix with your bare hands until the lumps disappear.\n • Next is to add the pepper to taste. If you wish, you may taste the mixture to check if the ingredients have the desired taste. \n • Finally, scoop into the materials you are using to wrap it.

 "responses": ["Nigerian fried rice is a multicolored dish of tasty yellow rice and a wide array of healthy vegetables. It is known as the sibling of jollof rice, and they are often served side-by-side with fried or roasted chicken at owanbes (Nigerian wedding parties), Christmas gatherings, or Sunday outings. Nigerian fried rice is made with stir-fried vegetables (excluding tomatoes, which is what makes it different from the tantalizing jollof rice) mixed with parboiled long-grain rice marinated in chicken stock. If you want to make it vegan, you can leave out the beef liver, pork, and chicken entirely! Enjoy this classic Nigerian fried rice recipe! \n Note: Don't be discouraged by the long list of ingredients as some of them are not mandatory and you can skip the ones that you are unable to source. However, curry powder, seasoning, stock and thyme are mandatory and should never miss from an authentic Nigerian fried rice. \nPREP TIME - 15 mins, COOK TIME - 45 mins, TOTAL TIME - 1 hr, COURSE - Main Course, CUISINE - Nigerian, SERVINGS - 4 people \nINGREDIENTS 8 tbsp vegetable oil/sunflower oil, 1 garlic clove, 2 tsps curry powder, 1 tbsp thyme/parsley/oregano, 3 tbsps diced green bell pepper, 1 tbsp butter or margarine, 2 medium-sized onions, 3 stock cubes (optional), 3 red bell pepper diced, 1 tbsp curry powder, 500g long-grain parboiled rice, 3 tbsp yellow bell pepper diced, 1 can sweet corn, 200g diced carrots, 100g green peas, 100g spring onion diced, 100g pork sausage diced, 100g liver cooked and chopped, 2kg whole chicken or chicken drumsticks. \nINSTRUCTIONS \n • To prepare the fried rice, wash all the vegetables. The carrots should be scraped and chopped into small cubes. Chop one onion and the spring onions. Set each of these apart. \n • Cook the liver and chop into small pieces. You can cook the liver alongside the chicken to save time. \n • Parboil the rice and cook for 15 minutes then drain using a colander. \n Prepare the chicken stock: \n • Put the chicken into a large pot, and add chopped onions, thyme, curry powder, garlic (chopped), and one chicken stock cube. \n • Cook for 20 minutes then remove the chicken and drain the chicken stock. The chicken stock is essential to add that chicken taste to the fried rice. However, if you do not have chicken, you can make your own stock by cooking chicken condiment spice, salt, and stock cubes for 10 minutes. Or better still, and saving time, use a canned chicken stock. However, nothing beats a delicious, fresh chicken stock. \nPrepare the rice: \n • Put the parboiled rice into a clean pot, pour in the chicken stock, and add a cup of water. If 1 cup is not sufficient, add another. However, the water should be at the same level as the rice, or slightly lower. This will prevent the rice becoming overcooked and will ensure all the water is absorbed. \n • Add some margarine or butter to the pot, and add the curry powder, thyme, pork sausage, chopped liver, and extra chopped garlic to the mixture. Stir and simmer for 10 minutes. \n • In a separate saucepan, add all your vegetables (both fresh and canned), a tablespoon of butter, one chicken stock cube, and a teaspoon of salt to taste. Stir fry for 2-3 minutes. \n • Pour the stir-fried veggies into the pot containing the rice and stir thoroughly. Cook for another 1 minute over low heat.\n • The rice ought to be cooked just right once the water is absorbed. The ideal fried rice has separate grains that are firm and bite-resistant. \n • Deep fry the drumsticks in hot oil for 15 minutes till golden-brown.Serve and enjoy!"],

Abacha is simply dried and shredded cassava while Ugba, on the other hand, is fermented African oil bean seed. Abacha was and still is an absolute favorite, mostly because it's so easy to prepare and the ingredients are easy to source. The key to making a good African Salad is to make sure that all the ingredients are well incorporated. As you will see below, there's a lot of add this, stir, add that, stir. You may wonder why you can't just add everything and stir, but if you do that, it will be very difficult for you to get a good blend of all the ingredients. Your African Salad will not be complete without Ugba. Ugba, also known as Ukpaka, is made from oil bean seeds. These seeds are cooked for several hours then sliced, washed, and left to ferment a little bit. Please note that Abacha and Ugba is NOT a hob/stove cooked dish, so don't be tempted to cook it. \nHow to Make Abacha and Ugba, Nigerian Salad: \n • Clean and gut your fish, then marinate with salt, curry, and Seasoning cube or seasoning. Leave to marinate in your fridge or a cool place for at least 30 minutes. Then grill for 45 minutes on high. \n • Soak the Abacha in cold water till soft, this should take roughly 10 minutes, and leave to drain in a colander.\n • Rinse the Ugba with warm water to get rid of any dirt.\n • Boil the stockfish with salt and seasoning till soft.\n • Dissolve the potash in 1 cup of water.\n • Blend the scotch bonnet, 1/2 of the onion, crayfish, and ground Ehuru till smooth and set aside.\n • Roast the Calabash nutmeg, then peel and grind it in a mortar or mill.\n • Pour the palm oil into a bowl or saucepan, gradually add the potash mixture. Mix thoroughly. You'll notice the palm oil will begin to thicken and the color will turn yellowy. Be careful not to add too much and be careful not to add the residue at the bottom of the bowl.\n • Now, add the pepper mix into the palm oil, add the shredded stockfish, Ogiri, then the Ugba, stir and combine. \n • Then add the Abacha, stir and combine. And it's ready.\n • You can mix in your chopped Utazi leaves now if you wish. I prefer to use them as a garnish. Be careful not to add too much Utazi, though; it's quite bitter and will affect the taste of your Abacha if added in excess.Enjoy....."],

This steamed bean pudding is made with tomato paste and onions and flavored with garlic, pepper and nutmeg, making this dish uniquely tasty.

Enjoy the recipe below! \n Moi moi may also pronounced Moin Moin, Moyin Moyin, Mai Mai is locally known as Olele and Alele. It is prepared by mixing peeled beans, then adding your preferred ingredients and heating it. Traditionally, moi moi is cooked in leaves, although there has been a lot of creativity in recent years. \nPREP TIME - 15 mins, COOK TIME - 45 mins, TOTAL TIME - 1 hr,COURSE - Appetizer, Breakfast, Brunch. CUISINE - African, Nigerian. SERVINGS - 5 people \nINGREDIENTS: 1 lb beans or 16 oz black-eye peas bag, 2 Maggi cubes, 1 tsp seasoning powder, 1 tsp salt, ½ big onion bulb or one small onion, 3 oz tomato paste, 2 small bell peppers, ½ tsp Nigerian red pepper or any other red chilli for a little spice, ½ tsp ground nutmeg, ¼ cup vegetable oil, 1-2 tbsp ground crayfish (optional), 2 cloves garlic, ½ tsp curry powder and 3 cups water for blending. \nHow to Make Moi-Moi: \n • Peel the beans using a bender. Put the beans into a bowl, add some water to cover them, and leave to soak for 10-15 minutes, or a little more.\n • Blend the beans with a little water a handful at a time; use the pulse setting to start and stop, without allowing the blender to go more than 3 seconds at a time. This will help the skin (of the soaked dry beans) to loosen. Put into another large bowl; repeat the process for all the beans.\n • To rinse, make sure the bowl with loosened beans has enough water, gently start rinsing off the floating chaff/skin. The skins should float to the top; they are lighter than the seed. The goal is to rinse off only the skin and not the (white) bean seed. Rinse thoroughly and set the clean seed aside.\n • Wash the onions, bell pepper, and garlic and set aside. Open the tin of tomato paste. Have ready a large clean mixing bowl.\n • Gently start blending the peeled beans, in batches, with onions, pepper, garlic, and a small amount of tomato paste plus water (yes, I like adding my tomato paste alongside the other ingredients and blending everything together.)\n • Once blended, pour the mixture into the big mixing bowl. Repeat the above process to blend the whole beans about three times or so. (For the amount of beans in this recipe, I use about 2½ -3 cups of water). After blending, place a big pot on the stove on a low heat and add small some water , about 1-1½ cups. If you have a steamer, this would work better. \n • In the big mixing bowl, add all the other condiments: salt, curry powder, red pepper, nutmeg, and vegetable oil and crush in the Maggi. Also, add ground crayfish if you using it. Use a wooden spoon to give a good stir to combine all the ingredients. Taste to ensure the flavors are how you want them before proceeding.\n • For this final process, you need a moi-moi wrapper (basically something to wrap the paste in to steam it. Some people use banana leaves, foil, or moi-moi pouches. Use a spoon or cup and gently scoop some moi-moi paste into the moi-moi pouch. Ensure that each bag has an equal amount of paste for even cooking. Close each wrapper tightly, then place them in the pot or steamer.\n • Repeat the process until you have used the entire mixture, cover the pot, and turn the heat from low to medium-high. As it steams, the water will evaporate. Ensure you keep adding water to the pot to avoid it drying out. Cook for about 30-35 minutes or until the moi-moi is ready (and you will know that it is ready by opening one of them and cutting right through. It will be firm and the color will have intensified a bit). If still in doubt, cook the moi-moi to the maximum cooking time! Serve on its own or with rice, avocado, or Nigerian stew..."],

Rinse about once or twice till you get clear water.\n • Cover and cook the yams for about 30 minutes, checking every 10 minutes or thereabout until the yams are fork tender.\n • Pound into a dough-like consistency until it's completely smooth with no yam chunks left.The amount of water you will need to boil the yam will vary depending on how dry the yam is. Fresh yams in the early season of the harvest will take less water while yams harvested in the later season will require more water.\n • This also applies during the pounding; you will need more water for the dry yam and less water for the less dry yams. \nServe with your favorite soup or stew! \nHow to make Pounded yam using a Blender: Pounded yam is a staple food, healthy and highly nutritious, however, it can be stressful to pound with the conventional mortar and pestle because it takes a lot of energy and sweat. Hence, using a blender makes it less stressful and also saves you time and energy. Without wasting your time, we will move to the steps needed to make a flawlessly blended yam without chunks. \n • Peel, rinse, and cut the white yams into medium-sized cubes. \n • Put the yam chunks in a pot, cover with water, and cook on medium heat. \n • Cook the yams until they are tender. The surrounding water should be hazy and slightly soupy, and a knife should be able to be inserted easily into the yam pieces. These are two indications of a well-done yam for preparing the ideal pounded yam. \n • When you're satisfied, drain the water from the yam and put it aside. \n • The container of your blender should now contain the cooked yam bits. Typically, I add a few yam cubes, blend for two seconds, and then add more. After about 5 seconds in the blender, your smooth, pounded yam will be ready. Continue to examine it, and when it's smooth, turn off the blender. The pounded yam becomes softer and more elastic, so there's no need to run your blender for too long."],

Once cooked, place the eggs in cold water to ensure the shell comes off easily.\n • Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, mixed spices (if using) and salt into an empty bowl. Mix thoroughly, then add the margarine/butter. Rub the butter into the flour with the tip of your fingers until crumbly (it should look like breadcrumbs).\n • Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and gently add water, a little at a time. Work the water into the flour to form a dough then knead until you get a smooth, non-sticky elastic dough. Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces and roll each into balls.\n • Dust a flat work surface with flour and roll out the dough pieces, one at a time. Wrap each piece around an egg and roll into a ball. Repeat until each piece of dough is rolled and wrapped about an egg.\n • Heat the oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat and fry egg rolls in batches until golden brown.

 "responses": ["Yoyo. To the south of Nigeria is the mighty Atlantic Ocean, and what this means is, a great deal of seafood, especially in the southern towns and cities. For instance, the people of Lagos state, one of the most industrious states of Nigeria, are known for some of their seafood delicacies. Steamed, stewed, dried, salted, barbecued, fried or smoked, there is a wide range of different delicious fish, shellfish, mollusc etc., to be enjoyed! Name it, crabs, prawns, shrimps, periwinkles, lobsters, clamps, sea snails etc, the range is huge. Even with all this, its surprising to discover that Nigeria is actually a seafood exporter, specifically shrimps/prawns!! In addition to the different types of fish/seafood which accompany many dishes, there is a certain snack/street food known to the Yorubas of Lagos State as yoyo (pronounced youryour...). Yoyo refers to the small fish, (baby herring, small-fry, smelt or whitebait) caught in the local body of waters called Osa (part of the Atlantic Ocean) seasoned with salt and chilli, deep fried, and sold on major inner city streets in Lagos particularly in the Isale Eko district of the state, and eaten as a snack or in combination with gari drink, fried yam or bread. Yoyo served with ice cold drink of Gari (plus some prawns & fried fish) \n Nutritional Data/Health Benefits...We did a little research on yoyo (smelt, whitebait, small-fry) and I discovered that these tiny fish are actually quite good for you! They are high in protein and are a good source of minerals (such as zinc, phosphorus, manganese and selenium) and vitamins (such as Vitamin B12 and Niacin). More importantly, yoyo is rich in monounsaturates; (the same type of healthy fat found in nuts) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, also known as omega-3 fatty acids, which are believed to reduce inflammation and are essential for memory and cognitive functions in the body. In other words, don't miss any chance you get to eat yoyo...below we share a very simple recipe for making them. \nWhat you need; 1 (500g) pack of frozen or fresh smelt/small-fry/whitebait, Some plain flour, Some seasoning (suya barbecue seasoning), Salt, Black pepper, Coconut oil (for frying) and Finely sliced bird's eye red chilli (for garnish). \nWhat to do: \n • Allow the fish to thaw completely if you bought them frozen. The fish do not usually need gutting, but wash thoroughly and allow to drain off all water/moisture using a colander/sieve. Note: it is important to allow all the water to drain off.\n • In a bowl, mix about 5 spoons of plain flour with 1-2 spoons of suya barbecue seasoning. (you can use any other preferred seasoning or spice). Also add some salt and freshly milled black pepper. \n • Dust the seasoned flour over the fish and ensure each gets a good coating. This coating will ensure the fish does not crumble during frying. Set the coated fish aside for about 30 minutes. This will allow any trace of moisture to be removed. Frying the fish wet will cause popping and spitting during frying. (Alternative to frying, you can grill or bake the coated fish in the oven, even though you have to note that the results won't be the same!)\n • Deep fry in hot coconut oil for about 10 minutes, or until fish turns slightly golden and crispy.\n • Drain excess oil using a kitchen towel and serve with ice cold gari drink, fried yam, bread or any other cold drink of choice."],

 "responses": ["African Breadfruit (Ukwa) - African breadfruit is in a food class of its own. I was not sure where to put it but finally settled for beans section because breadfruit seeds are most similar to beans. It is known as Ukwa in Igbo and the scientific name is Treculia africana. Ukwa is such a versatile food with a natural delicious flavour. It can be cooked plain without any ingredient, not even salt and it will taste great especially when prepared with fresh Ukwa. It can be roasted and eaten with coconut or palm kernel. It can also be prepared as a porridge which is what this page is about. \n Ingredients - 700g African Breadfruit, 2 medium dry fish, 2 small stock cubes, 7g edible potash, Palm oil (enough to colour), 5-6 fresh bitter leaves, Pepper & Salt (to taste). Common additions to Breadfruit Porridge: White Puna yam, Corn/Maize, you can also use sweet corn. \n Notes on the ingredients \n Freshly peeled ukwa or dried ukwa can be used for this recipe. \n You can use stock fish instead of dry fish or both.\n By fresh bitter leaves I mean bitter leaves that have NOT been washed and squeezed. \n Always add enough palm oil to make your Nigerian meals look appetizing.\n Edible potash acts as food tenderizer. Only a very small quantity should be used. If you are lucky to buy freshly dehusked ukwa seeds from the same tree, you will not need to use the food tenderiser. I do not know any alternative to edible potash. \n Before you cook the Ukwa..If using dry ukwa, soak it overnight in plenty of cold water. If using fresh ukwa, skip this step. The next day, soak, debone and wash the dry fish or stock fish and break into pieces. Wash the ukwa thoroughly in cold water. Stones and sand usually settle at the bottom so watch out for those. Pound the pepper. Rinse the bitter leaves and set aside. \n Cooking Directions \n 1. Put the thoroughly washed ukwa in a sizeable pot. I used a pressure pot because it cooks the ukwa much faster. \n 2. Pour enough water to cover the ukwa. The level of water should be about 1 inch above the level of the ukwa. \n 3. Add the edible potash. Add the dry fish or stock fish, cover the pot and cook till well done. The ukwa is done when the seeds melt when pressed. You may need to top up the water while cooking so watch it closely. If using a pressure pot, top ups will not be necessary. \n 4. Add enough palm oil to the well done ukwa, add pepper, stock cubes and salt to taste. \n 5. Stir. Cover and cook on medium heat till the palm oil changes colour from red to yellow. This should take about 5 minutes. \n 6. Stir and add the bitter leaves. \n 7. Cover and leave to simmer or till the leaves wilt but still green and the ukwa is ready to be served. \n 8. Cooking Ukwa with a Pressure Pot \n 9. If you have a pressure pot, ukwa is one of the Nigerian recipes that you should use it for because it cuts the cooking time by a lot. \n 10. For pressure pots, follow the directions above up till Step 2. \n 11. Then for step 3, add edible potash, dry fish or stock fish, pepper, salt to taste, stock cubes and palm oil. \n 12. Cover, pressurize and cook for 30 minutes. I set the pressure on my pot to 1 and my cooker to heat 7 (my burner's heat settings range from 1-9). \n 13. After 30 minutes with the above settings, the ukwa should be well done. Depressurize the pot under running water and add the bitter leaves. \n 14. Cover and cook till the vegetables wilt but are still green. There is no need to pressurize the pot during this step. \n Stir and it's done! \n Note: Breadfruit Porridge gets thicker as it cools down so ensure you have enough porridge in the meal when done. Serve with chilled palm wine, palmy. Awww! Or any other chilled drink."],

You can also sprinkle some cornmeal over the rolled-out dough. \n Heat enough oil in a frying pan and allow to get hot to about 350 degrees F. You can also test the oil by dipping the thin part of a ladle into the oil, if it sizzles it's hot enough you can also drop some cornmeal into the oil and if it sizzles then start to fry. If the kokoro turns brown immediately the oil is too then turn down the heat if not the thick part will fry quickly that the rest of the kokoro. Fry until golden brown and crunchy to your preference.

All you need is a dash of salt, and a sprinkle olive oil to make these healthy baked ripe plantains then serve it up with freshly made guacamole! \n #ProTip: When it comes to grilling, roasting, or baking, the ripe yellow sweet plantains do not go overboard with spices and herbs to the extent that overwhelms or overpowers its sweet deliciousness and when it comes to eating, there are options such as spicy pepper sauce, roasted peanuts, or perhaps eat them with guacamole. No matter what you chose to eat your baked ripe plantains with, it surely will be delicious. Naturally sweet yellow ripe plantains can be cooked in several ways. Today, we will bake and serve these with mashed avocado. Total Time: 55 minutes \n INGREDIENTS: 2 fully ripe plantains, 1 avocado, 1 tablespoon of olive oil (or less; for brushing/rubbing plantains before baking), Salt (according to your taste), Black pepper, Crushed red pepper (according to your taste) and 2 tablespoons of chopped red/purple onions. \n How to cook plantains, baked and healthy. \nStep 1: wash, peel, and bake in the oven. Preheat oven to 400. \n • Wash plantains; dry with a pepper towel then peel plantain, and gently slice/cut in the middle.\n • Cover a baking pan/sheet with foil, and place a baking wire rack on it.\n • Sprinkle a little salt and oil on the sliced plantains, and use clean hands to rub, making sure the salt and oil are well distributed. \n • Place the plantains on a rack, and place the rack in a preheated oven.\n • Bake until fully cooked and slightly golden and a little charred. Flip over after about 15 to 20 minutes in baking to allow for even cooking on both sides. Total cooking may take between 35 - 45 minutes; (sometimes cooking time may depend on the oven, that is how hot it gets.) Keep your eyes on these do not burn it. Remove from the oven after baking, and serve hot. \nStep 2: Prepare the guacamole: Guacamole is one of the easiest yet yummiest foods! Literally a perfect dip for anything! Lime juice is a must if not serving immediately, unless you are allergic to it! For the Guacamole: \n • Wash and cut the avocado, gently remove the seed and scoop it into a clean bowl.\n • Add some black pepper, sprinkle some salt, and crushed red pepper.\n • Mash roughly, I like to see some textures, but mash according to how you want it!\n • Squeeze in some lime juice if you wish, but especially if you are not serving this immediately, as it prevents from turning brown.\n • Finally, add the purple onions, totally optional. Boli served hot with freshly made guacamole, this recipe serves two people. \nNOTES - Refrain from using the overly ripe plantains that may appear black and soft because they won't maintain their shape after cooking. Moreover, they can quickly burn and not taste good! You can surely roast/bake this without oil or oil spray, but we think a little oil rub makes look even more appetizing. Serve this with spicy pepper sauce or roasted peanuts just like in Nigeria and even though you can also roast/grill or bake the green/unripe plantains. They equally taste yummy but not sweet, unlike the ripe ones."],
